# PROJECT OBJECTIVE 

This project, titled "Business Proposal Presenter", is a dashboard I created using Tableau to analyze and visualize video game sales data. The goal was to present clear and interactive visual insights about:

• Total sales by genre

• Sales trends over time (by year and genre)

• Top 10 best-selling game titles

• Top 10 platforms and publishers by sales

I also added filters for zone sales and date range, so users can explore the data based on specific time periods and regions.

# PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT

• I wanted to create a professional, interactive dashboard that could be used in business proposals or presentations.

• This project helps in understanding what sells best, when, and on which platforms — which is valuable information for any gaming company or investor.

• It shows how data storytelling can influence decision-making in the real world — not just by showing numbers, but by making insights visual and actionable.

• I chose this topic because it's interesting, widely relatable, and offers multiple angles for analysis (genre, time, platform, publisher).
